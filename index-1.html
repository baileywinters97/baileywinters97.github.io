                        <p>All Nashville is a chill. And everywhere</p>
                        <p>Like desert sand, when the winds blow,</p>
                        <p>There is each moment sifted through the air,</p>
                        <p>A powdered blast of January snow.</p>
                        <p>O! thoughtless Dandelion, to be misled</p>
                        <p>By a few warm days to leave thy natural bed,</p>
                        <p>Was folly growth and blooming over soon.</p>
                        <p>And yet, thou blasted yellow-coated gem,</p>
                        <p>Full many a heart has but a common boon</p>
                        <p>With thee, now freezing on thy slender stem.</p>
                        <p>When the heart has bloomed by the touch of love's warm breath</p>
                        <p>Then left and chilling snow is sifted in,</p>
                        <p>It still may beat but there is blast and death</p>
                        <p>To all that blooming life that might have been.</p>

                            <p>George Marion McClellan was a minister, teacher, writer, and poet.</p>
                            <p>He obtained his degree from Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
                            <p>He had later married Augusta Rabb in 1888 in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
                            <p>His poetry has a special language. It speaks of religion, nature,</p>
                            <p>and romance, as well as showing the true face of discrimination.</p>
                            <p>One of his poems, "To Theodore", was written about his son, who sadly</p>
                            <p>died from complications of tuberculosis. George continued to fight</p>
                            <p>for racial justice throughout his entire life. He then died on May 17th,1934</p>
                            <p>at the age of 73.</p>
